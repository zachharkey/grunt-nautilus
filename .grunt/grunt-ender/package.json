Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-ender --save-dev\n```\n\nOne the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-ender');\n```\n\n## The \"ender\" task\n\n### Overview\nThis is a temporary utility for handling Ender builds without having to always type `--use` or `--output`. Note that there is an official solution for this problem [discussed on github](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender/issues/131) that should be available soon. In the meantime, you can use this grunt task to help make using Ender easier.\n\nUsage is simple. In your Gruntfile, add an `ender` task and under the `options` part you can specify the output location and the list of dependencies.\n\n```js\nender: {\n  options: {\n    output: \"public/scripts/vendor/ender\",\n    dependencies: [\"bean\", \"bonzo\", \"qwery\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe example above would save the Ender build to \"public/scripts/vendor/ender.js\".\n\nAfter this, you can run `grunt ender` to build (or rebuild) your library. Use `grunt ender --info` to see which libraries are currently in use.\n\n#### Other notes\n\n- It's expected that you include all of the Ender dependencies in the standard `dependencies` key of the package.json file as well. This way the grunt task doesn't have to deal with installing anything (assuming you run `npm install` as usual) and you can specify the versions you need there.\n- To reiterate from above, this is a temporary hold-over until the official solution from Ender is in place. There are no guarantees about updates or bug fixes to this plugin once that is released.\n- When you run `grunt ender` or `grunt ender:build` it will actually rebuild the library from scratch. The regular Ender `add` and `remove` commands are not utilized directly. This means that to add and remove libraries from the Ender build, edit your Gruntfile as appropriate.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\nIn your Gruntfile.js\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  ender: {\n    options: {\n      output: \"public/scripts/vendor/ender\",\n      dependencies: [\"bean\", \"bonzo\", \"qwery\"]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Building the Ender Library\n\n`grunt ender` or `grunt ender:build`\n\n#### Information About the Current Build\n`grunt ender --info` or `grunt ender:info`\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n\n- **0.2.0** - remove usage of package.json\n- **0.1.0** - first version\n",
